# Prompt Idea for a Snake (Nokia-Style) Web Game PRD

Use the following prompt when you want an AI assistant or teammate to generate a comprehensive Project Requirements Document (PRD) for a classic Nokia-style Snake game implemented for the web.

## Goal
- Clearly outline gameplay, visuals, controls, and progression based on the original Nokia Snake experience.
- Capture modern web constraints (responsive layout, accessibility) while preserving retro aesthetics.
- Define technical requirements, milestones, and success metrics suitable for a small web project.

## Suggested Prompt Structure
1. **Context & Vision**
   - Summarize the nostalgic Nokia Snake inspiration and the target audience (casual players, mobile nostalgia seekers).
   - Specify that the deliverable is a PRD covering scope, features, UX, technical stack, timelines, and risks.

2. **Gameplay Requirements**
   - Ask for detailed descriptions of the grid, snake movement, food spawning, scoring, difficulty curve, and game-over conditions.
   - Request optional enhancements (e.g., wrap-around mode, obstacles, multiple speed levels).

3. **User Experience & Visual Design**
   - Require guidelines for retro monochrome styling, pixel art assets, typography, and sound effects reminiscent of early Nokia devices.
   - Include responsive layout expectations for desktop and mobile browsers, plus accessibility considerations (keyboard support, color contrast).

4. **Technical Specifications**
   - Specify desired web technologies (HTML5 canvas or CSS grid, vanilla JS or a lightweight framework).
   - Request architecture notes (game loop, state management, input handling) and integration hooks (analytics, PWA support).

5. **Project Management Elements**
   - Ask for milestones, resource assumptions, testing strategy, QA checklist, and deployment plan.
   - Include success metrics (performance, frame rate, load time, retention) and risk mitigation strategies.

6. **Deliverables & Format**
   - Clarify that the output should be a structured PRD with sections, bullet points, and tables as needed.
   - Encourage inclusion of acceptance criteria and glossary of key terms.

## Example Prompt
> "You are a product manager creating a Project Requirements Document for a Nokia-inspired Snake web game. Draft a comprehensive PRD that covers: product vision, target users, detailed gameplay mechanics, UX and visual design guidelines, accessibility requirements, technical architecture (including HTML5/JS stack), analytics considerations, project timeline with milestones, testing and QA approach, launch plan, success metrics, and identified risks with mitigations. Emphasize retro Nokia aesthetics while ensuring responsive, accessible web delivery. Present the PRD with clear sections, bullet points, and tables where appropriate."

## Tips
- Tailor the prompt with any specific constraints (team size, deadline, localization needs).
- If you need brainstorming variants, add "Provide three alternative feature sets for future releases" or similar optional clauses.
- Encourage the assistant to reference modern web best practices while maintaining the nostalgic feel.
